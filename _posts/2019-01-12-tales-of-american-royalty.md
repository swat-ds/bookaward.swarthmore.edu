# "Tales of American Royalty - An Exercise of American History" 
## by *Paul Cato* 

Tales of American Royalty: An Exercise of American History On my 8th birthday my father presented me with a copy of Richard Tregaskis' John F. Kennedy and PT-109, a book written one year before John F. Kennedy's assassination retelling his heroics during the Second World War. Four months later I overheard reports on the radio discussing the death of Kennedy's son John, "John-John" Jr. in a plane crash in New England. I remember asking my mother something to the extent of "why does everyone make such a big deal about the Kennedys haven't lots of politicians died?" Her only answer was that there were so few of them left and people her age cared about them dearly. Unable to grasp an entire generation's love of people they had never met, I went on to imagine the presence of Kennedy and his family -  desperately seeking insight as to what it was that made them so special. This was achieved by amassing a large collection of books on the subject -  books ranging from biographies, to analyses, to collections of speeches.

Yet the collection has served as more than just at outlet for my interest and obsession with the Kennedy family. Though I did not realize it my book collecting has reflected and helped develop my own understanding of history -  and the pride I took in the books I had found was born not just of the collection's expansiveness, but because I felt it reflected American history in an accurate way, even iffrom a unique perspective. My collection of Kennedy literature helps illustrate my vision of American history as made up offour components: myth, memory, narrative, and artifact -  each of which is reflected by several books within the corpus of Kennedy literature. I have divided the following bibliography according to these four categories, in hopes that such a division -  one marked both by genre and significance -  will help better illustrate the effects these books have had on my understanding of history 

The foundation of my personal understanding of American history is composed of myth. Those figures and events which stand out most in the American mind hold a mythological significance: George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Martin Luther King -  such men are remembered not just for their accomplishments but for their legacies as well. It was in this way that I first engaged with the Kennedys -  through stories told to me by my mother and father-and it was these myths that spurred my eagerness to come to understand the individuals behind the rumors and fond memories of baby boomers, 60 Minutes specials, and the like. Kennedy literature is composed almost entirely of mythic texts -  whether biographical, historical, analytical, or political, most texts concerning some aspect of the Kennedy family seeks to address a myth tied to one of its members. These texts feed off of America's inability to separate the Kennedys from their myths, a feat that does not necessarily need to be taken up by all. For some reason or another my time spent in the corner ofthe JFK library sent me a journey to do just that: see through the myths, yet without texts such as Hersh's The Dark Side o/Camelot or Shesol's Mutual Contempt I would have nothing to expand or build upon. "Mythic Kennedy literature" has served to build the frameworks for my understanding of each of the Kennedys and is  an essential component of collection. 

Tied closely to mythology is memory: those historical items which serve to commemorate and provide remembrance of an intimate sort. One cannot be surprised as to the amount of commemorative material one can find tied to the Kennedy family: not only have they served as a sort of "American royalty," but two of their foremost members were gunned down publicly at the within five years of one another. Yet while one will find many a postcard, picture, glazed mug, etc. marked prominently by Kennedy likenesses, the amount of commemorative literature is surprisingly small. Consisting only of material written by those who knew the family and its members well, the small number of commemorative texts seems to suggest that the Kennedys' essences are too tied up in myth for such sentimental to catch America's attention. During my cynical "Kennedy free" years I remember thinking to myself"another book by a Kennedy child?" upon seeing Caroline's book on my mother's bookshelf. Yet for an individual like myself, for whom myth is not enough sentiment is needed to help bring these figures to live: it is not enough to hear my mother's memories of a man gunned down when she was eleven, true engagement with JFK requires the thoughts of his daughter and other intimates as well. 

More than just stories, narratives serve as in depth portrayals of persons, events, or things. Not restricted to historical analyses of singular events or lives, I consider a narrative to be any piece of writing which provides readers with enough information to engage with the subject in an almost firsthand manner. The best narratives are typically objective -  free of the bias commonly found in any historical or political literature (especially that concerning the Kennedy family) -  and in depth -  it is rare that one will find expansive, objective biographies of any of the major Kennedy figures. I consider several texts within my collection to fit the label "narrative." All are in-depth, objective, and paint lifelike pictures of their subject, and all have played a large part in shaping my understandings of the Kennedy family and its various members. 

I use the term "artifact" to denote those items which speak for themselves. While in the greater historical framework this might include anything from important landmarks to treasured pieces of art, within the context of 
Kennedy literature I believe artifacts to be those pieces written by the family members themselves: texts which literally contain the thoughts of Jack, Bobby, et. al. While these writings on their own cannot provide an accurate image of their corresponding family member given their subjection to the editing process both during their composition process and later, during their publication, the Kennedy's words -  be the in the form of speeches, quotes, or sayings -  help reveal some portion of their speaker's essence. "Artifacts" within my collection range from compilations of speeches, such as 1988's Let the World Go Forth to non-fiction texts such as collections of political essays such as Bobby's To Seek a Newer World. 

Ultimately my collection of Kennedy literature has helped bring about two things. Firstly, it has brought these historical figures to life. Though I once used to hear reports on the news of John, Jr. son of John F. Kennedy, Sr. Or Robert F. -  these names would mean nothing to me: I did not grow up during the 1960s or 1970s and had no true understanding of the Kennedys' significance to my parents generation. Kennedy literature changed all that. Through the use of myth, memory, narrative, and artifact the Kennedys - dead or alive have become real live figures to me. Already a foremost hero, Bobby Kennedy is now more than the individual who gave the "Day of Affirmation Address," he is, instead, the "ruthless," loving brother, who cared more about family -  both his extended and immediate family -  than political ambition or success. Secondly, my collection has helped frame my unique understanding of American history. Jackie Kennedy, once imagined to be a vain and shallow due to the short time in which she remarried and started anew soon became a grieving widower robbed of her loving, but unfaithful, husband. For a long time I knew I considered history to be "more thanjust facts," though in hat way, and to what degree, I was unaware. The distinctions within Kennedy literature helped to clarify and provide me with understanding, and I now have a firmer grasp on my impression of history. Texts on the Kennedys will continue to be published and I look forward to expanding and diversifying my collection all the more in coming years.

#### Annotated Bibliography

### Myth:

1) *John F. Kennedy and PT-I09 (Richard Tregaskis, 1962)* 

John F. Kennedy and the PT-J09 chronicles the events that took place during Jack's service on Patrol Torpedo Boat 109. Responsible for leading the crew to safety after the ship was attacked by the Japanese, Kennedy towed one of his crewmates to safety and was awarded a commendation for his actions. The events branded Jack a War Hero and were a frequent topic during his later campaigns. Tregaskis' book was my first on the Kennedy's, a gift from my father on my 8th birthday. Not a serious historical study, PT-J09 is  a light and enjoyable read and helped serve as a catalyst to my interest in the Kennedys.

2) *The Sins of the Father: Joseph P. Kennedy and the Dynasty he Founded (Ronald Kessler, 1996)*

Modern depictions of the 1960s will often allude to the "sinister" actions of the original Kennedy (see Mad Men, Season 1). Although Joe would later come to be overshadowed by Jack, Bobby, and Ted within American memory, one cannot argue that Joe Kennedy did not develop a mythic legacy -  though negative -  for himself. Although Joe Sr.'s actions are often discussed in books about the Kennedy brothers, no study or authoritative biography of the man existed until the 1996 publication of Sins o/the Father. Kessler discusses the life of the man responsible for cementing his family's influence in the country and details the various steps he took to ensure his sons successes, despite the suspicion such actions aroused.

3) *The Dark Side of Camelot (Seymour M. Hersh, 1997)*

One of the first "controversial" studies of John F. Kennedy, The Dark Side o/Camelot helped establish the tradition of intense investigative journalism that come to define Kennedy scholarship. Whereas the books of Arthur Schlesinger sought to glorify the lives of the Kennedy men, Hersh's text presented Camelot in a new light, revealing a JFK unseen by the American public of the 1960s. A bestseller and sensational publication, The Dark Side o/Camelot ranks alongside A  Thousand Days as one the authoritative books on the Kennedy presidency.

4) *Mutual Contempt: Lyndon Johnson, Robert Kennedy, and the Feud That Defined a Decade (Jeff Shesol,1997)*

The relationship between LBJ and Bobby gained mythic status as early as the 1960 election. Known for his supposed "ruthlessness" Bobby was a vehement defender of his brother's interests and did not hesitate to go the offensive when he sensed ill intentions on the part of others. Bobby remained Attorney General some 90 days after his brother's death before resigning. His tenure in the Justice Department was marked by heated arguments and frequent clashes with Lyndon Johnson, Jack's Vice-President and later replacement. Mutual Contempt is the story of the bitter rivalry between the two figures and the role this "contempt" played in shaping politics throughout the 1960s. A well-written historical study, Mutual Contempt was purchased while at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library in the summer of 2007. Though Shesol's work is objective, I must categorize this as a "mythic text" -Mutual Contempt is a historical analysis of an aspect of the Kennedy experience which has gained its own life and continues to be discussed to this very day.

5) *The Last Campaign: Robert F. Kennedy and 82 Days That Inspired America (Thurston Clarke, 2008)*

A study of Bobby Kennedy's 3-month Presidential campaign, The Last Campaign reflects on the role Kennedy played in developing the revolutionary spirit of 1968 and explores his status as hero to much of the American populace in the days leading up to his assassination that June. Clarke does not shy away from his intentions on recreating the presence that Bobby took up during the 1968 campaign: RFK stood a symbol of modern progressivism, a figure admired by minorities, workers, young people, and middle class Americans alike. 

6) *Brothers: The Hidden History of the Kennedy Years (David Talbot, 2007)*

While many of the books on Bobby and Jack discuss their intimate relationship, Talbot's text is one of the first to focus on it entirely. Well-written and respected as solid scholarship, Brothers lacks the sensationalism carried by books such The Dark Side o/Camelot, while not shying away from drama and controversy in manner similar to Schlesinger's texts. The relationship between the two brothers is a topic of constant speculation, and just as Shesol's book engages with a mythic topic and thus must be framed under such a heading, so too must Talbot's Brothers.

7) *Once Upon a Secret: My Affair with President John F. Kennedy and Its Aftermath (Mimi Alford, 2012)*

My most recent purchase, Once Upon a Secret is former White House intern Mimi Alford's memoir on her affair with JFK during the summer of her 19th year. When I first read about the book I disregarded it as just another discussion of Jack's infidelities, ascribing the subject to gossip and rumors. Yet a Today Show interview with the book's author led me to reevaluate my assumptions as I soon realized the effects Alford's story could have on Jack's legacy and image in the public sphere. Loyalty to the Kennedy name prevented me from giving Alford's story any credit and my refusal to even read reviews highlighted my fondness for the family, as well as my great bias and unwillingness to view the figures objectively.

### Memory:

8) *Robert Kennedy Remembered LDVDl (Charles Guggenheim, 1968)*

Shown at the 1968 Democratic Convention to honor the life of the recently assassinated Presidential Candidate, Robert Kennedy Remembered was purchased along with many of my other RFK materials at the Presidential Library in Massachusetts. A touching tribute, the documentary is less a piece of scholarship and more so a celebration of Bobby's various achievements in the public sphere. 

9) *Robert Kennedy and His Times (Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., 1978)*

In 1978 Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. followed his groundbreaking study of the Kennedy Presidency (see above) with this National Book Award winning biography of Jack's brother. Still considered the foremost account of Bobby's life, Robert Kennedy and His Times drew material from RFK's private papers and helped Ted bring the name "Kennedy" to the forefront of minds nationwide. A long text, Schlesinger's biography took me over two years to complete and I followed up my mass market paperback edition with a first edition copy from 1978. There is  an undeniable intimacy to be found within the pages of Robert Kennedy and His Times marking this a work of memory rather than objective biography 

10) *Let the Word Go Forth: The Speeches, Statements, and Writings of John F. Kennedy 1947 to 1963 (Ted Sorensen, 1988)*

A collection of President Kennedy's speeches and assorted statements, Let the Word Go Forth was compiled by Jack's advisor and speechwriter Ted Sorensen some 25 years after Kennedy's death. Purchased during my visit to the Kennedy library in Summer 2007, the text is  a perfect example of the many collections of quotes and speeches released as tributes to America's fallen leader. 

11) *Make Gentle the Life of This World: The Vision of Robert F. Kennedy (Maxwell Taylor Kennedy, 1999)*

A scholar at heart Bobby Kennedy kept notebooks full of quotes, with him at all times and was frequently seen reading texts by Classical authors such as Aeschylus. As a tribute to his father, Bobby's son Maxwell compiled many of these quotes and sayings and presented them alongside his father's own inspirational musing. A purchase made soon after my trip to the Kennedy library, I've kept Make Gentle the Life a/This World with me on most trips and vacations, similar to the manner in which Bobby held onto his personal notebook and journal. 

12) *Profiles In Courage For Our Time (Caroline Kennedy, 2003)*

A modem day version of her father's Pulitzer Prize winning book, Profiles in Courage For Our Time discusses various modern American heroes in much the same way that Jack's text did in 1955. 

13) *The Gospel According to RFK: Why It Matters Now (Robert F. Kennedy, ed. Norman MacAfee, 2004)*

Similar to Sorensen's JFK compilation, The Gospel According to RFK is a collection of Bobby's speeches made during his 1968 campaign for President. It prominently features Kennedy's announcement of the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. Not as wide in scope as In His Own Words, The Gospel According to RFK appears to be an attempt to show Bobby and his words as a resource a younger generation who has experienced difficulties of a magnitude similar to the crises of the 1960s.

### Narrative:

14) *A Thousand Days: John F. Kennedy in the White House (Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., 1965)*

The first comprehensive text on a member of the Kennedy family, A  Thousand Days won Arthur Schlesinger both a National Book Award and Pulitzer Prize and helped establish his legacy as the first and foremost Kennedy scholar. Schlesinger would go on to write several other texts on the members of the Kennedy's, but A  Thousand Days continues to be considered his best. I own both a first edition, hardcover printing of the book and a newer paperback copy used for reading and studying. 

15) *President Kennedy: Profile of Power (Richard Reeves, 1993)*

A thoroughly researched study of the nation's 35th President, Reeves' biography is an objective chronicle of JFK's life and presidency, lacking the subjectivity found in authors such as Schlesinger. A piece of scholarship as opposed to a tribute, while Profile of Power does assess and provide commentary on its subject it does so fairly and objectively. Reeves is the author of several other Presidential biographies, including accounts on Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon 

16) *The Kennedy Women: The Saga of an American Family (Laurence Leamer, 1994)*

Ever since Jackie Kennedy took residence on Pennsylvania A venue, the Kennedy women have captivated the American public almost as much as their husbands. Leamer's text discusses the various female members of the Kennedy family, be they the wives, sisters, or daughters often overlooked when it comes to scholarship and biography. 

17) *America's Queen: A Life of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis (Sarah Bradford, 2000)*

Full of photographs and illustrations and drawing on a variety of reliable sources, Bradford's biography provides an in-depth picture of the woman who redefined the title of First Lady. An account of Jackie's life before, during, and after the Kennedy Presidency, America's Queen depicts Jackie in full and ranks among the foremost texts regarding a figure whose presence equaled those of every other Kennedy remember 

18) *An Unfinished Life: John F. Kennedy, 1917 -1963 (Robert Dallek, 2003)*

Provided with full access to the Kennedy papers, in 2003 Robert Dallek released one of the most in-depth studies of John F. Kennedy since Arthur Schlesinger's 1000 Days (see below). An epic of sorts, An Unfinished Life provides a detailed account of JFK's 46 years and sheds new light on many of the events and issues that surrounded Jack's Presidency. 

19) *The Kennedys: America's Emerald Kings: A Five-Generation History of the Ultimate Irish-Catholic Family (Thomas Maier, 2003)*

Maier's expansive history of the Kennedys looks at the family as a whole, focusing especially on its Irish roots and the effects of its Irish heritage on its members and public image. As explained in the title, Emerald Kings is a multi generational study and does not restrict itself to one era, as most all books on the Kennedys seem to. 

20) *Robert Kennedy: His Life (Evan Thomas, 2004)*

In what might be considered the best RFK biography since Schlesinger's, Evan Thomas presents Bobby in a manner wholly accessible and appealing to today's generation. Rather than glorifying or demonizing his subject, as is done in many books about the Kennedys, Thomas goes through great efforts to humanize Bobby, depicting the many aspects of one of the most complicated figures in recent American history. The quality of His Life helps highlight the over simplicity of many portrayals of Robert Francis Kennedy and makes it a pleasure to  read for those not seeking a study as intense as Schlesinger's massive Robert Kennedy and His Times. 

21) *Last Lion: The Fall and Rise of Ted Kennedy (Peter Canellos, 2009)*

One of the first authoritative studies of Ted Kennedy, Rise and Fall discusses Edward Kennedy's life and career, especially after the tragic Chappaquiddick incident and his subsequent rise in the American political arena. Whereas many books on the Kennedy brothers discuss their subjects in relation to John, Last Lion proves successful at focusing on Ted alone, leaving discussions of the family and his brothers on the periphery. A gift from my mother, I received Canellos' book immediately after it was published, along with Ted's memoir True Compass.

### Artifact:

22) *Profiles in Courage (John F. Kennedy, 1955)*

JFK's Pulitzer Prize winning study of various American heroes, Profiles in Courage was a best seller and helped the recently elected Senator gamer national attention. Having been republished numerous times, the text has never gone out of print and has served as a benchmark for later books written by any member of the Kennedy family -  especially those by Bobby and Ted. As has been the case with each of Jack's successes, there has been widespread speculation as to whether he deserved he received. Many critics argue that Kennedy merely "authorized" and "oversaw the production" of the text, leaving research and composition to be taken up by various scholars and scribes. When I first received a copy of the text -  around age twelve or thirteen, along with Profiles in Courage for Our Time (see below) by Caroline Kennedy, Jack's daughter, such rumors and speculation had Yet even these detractors cannot deny the book's significance: Jack's Pulitzer 

23) *The Enemy Within: The McClellan Committee's Crusade Against Jimmy Hoffa And Corrupt Labor Unions (Robert F. Kennedy, 1960)*

Bobby Kennedy's 1960 book tells of the Senate Select Committee's investigation of American gangster Jimmy Hoffa. Kennedy served as chief general counsel to the committee as it initiated a major investigation of organized crime in the nation. In the same way that Just Friends would serve as a precursor to Bobby's later books on civic issues, The Enemy Within, a "historical-memoir" of sorts, might be viewed as a precursor to Thirteen Days, his famous account of the White House during the Cuban Missile Crisis. 

24) *Just Friends and Brave Enemies (Robert F. Kennedy, 1962)*

Bobby's account of his 1962 Goodwill Tour around the globe showcases the humanism that would mark RFK's later texts -  in particular Pursuit of Justice and To Seek a Newer World (see below). A discussion of the various topics brought up when he and his wife Ethel visited locales such as Japan, Indonesia, and West Berlin, Just Friends and Brave Enemies has gone out of print and was very difficult to find. I own a first edition hardback copy, purchased from a small bookseller online. 

25) *Pursuit of Justice (Robert F. Kennedy, 1964)*

A series of essays discussing issues that arose during his tenure as Attorney General, Pursuit of Justice illustrates Bobby's deep insight on American society -  the very same insight that would make him an American hero during the mid to late 1960s. 

26) *To Seek a Newer World (Robert F. Kennedy, 1968)*

The most important Kennedy book I own, To Seek a Newer World has a special place in my heart and has solidified Bobby's role as my top hero. The text gathers together Bobby's thoughts on the various political issues that faced the nation during the 1968 election, both foreign and domestic, and helps illustrate why he can be considered alongside Teddy Roosevelt, Barack Obama, and FDR as one of America's foremost progressive leaders. The collection provides a perfect summary of Bobby's political thought, and a comparison with his earlier texts allows readers insight into the development of his views from his time as Attorney General to almost-President of the United States. I own two copies of To Seek a Newer World: my first, a paperback, mass market edition was purchased at the Kennedy library, while my second, a first edition hardback was obtained last year. 

27) *Thirteen Days: A Memoir of the Cuban Missile Crisis (Robert F. Kennedy, 1969)*

Robert F. Kennedy's famous account of the Cuban Missile crisis, Thirteen Days is  an exciting read and serves as a perfect introduction to texts on the Kennedy's. Relatively short, the book avoids the politics surrounding and leading up to the crisis, focusing instead on John's leadership during one of the most strenuous periods in our nation's history. The book was released after Bobby's death in 1969, and like his brother's text Profiles in Courage (see below),it has consistently remained in print.

28) *Robert Kennedy in His Own Words: The Unpublished Recollections of the Kennedy Years (Robert F. Kennedy, 1988)*

Much like Jacqueline Kennedy: Historic Conversations, In His Own Words features the transcripts of interviews taken for the Kennedy Presidential Library in the years following JFK's assassination. Bobby recounts his experiences while serving his brother, in what is  has become a firsthand account of the inner workings of Camelot. 

29) *America Back on Track (Edward M. Kennedy, 2006)*

Ted Kennedy's call for America to return to its core values and ideas was released at the height of the Bush presidency, during what he saw as a "crossroads". Unlike the works of Bobby and Jack, America Back on Track focuses less on the nation's history on more on its future and ideals. 

30) *True Compass: A Memoir (Edward M. Kennedy, 2009)*

True Compass is Ted Kennedy's autobiography, released in January 2009, only seven months before his death in August. Though True Compass lacks some of the objectivity found in the memoirs of Jackie and Bobby, the text helps readers reflect on the life of the 20t century's foremost leaders, and is written with a level of honesty not always present in the politicians' autobiographies. A gift from my mother, I received this alongside True Lion (see below) one of the first authoritative biographies of Edward M. Kennedy. 

31) *Jacqueline Kennedy: Historic Conversations on Life with John F. Kennedy (Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, 2011)*

Following her husband's assassination, Jackie Kennedy worked with Bobby and Arthur Schlesinger to compile an  oral history of her life with John. The interview resulted in hours of recordings, which Jackie refused to have published. In Fall 2011, the Kennedy family approved the released of the materials from the holdings of the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library, publishing the material in the form of a book and a set of 8-CDs. The collection not only provides insight into life with Jack but also showcases Jackie in a new light -  a woman who has let go of her private exterior to commemorate her recently lost husband.
