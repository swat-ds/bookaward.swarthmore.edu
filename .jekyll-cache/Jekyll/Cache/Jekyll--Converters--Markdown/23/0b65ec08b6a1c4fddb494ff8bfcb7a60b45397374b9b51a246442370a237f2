  <h2 id="by-ben-goosen">by <em>Ben Goosen</em></h2>

  <p>The Hobbit has been my favorite book since I was seven. I first heard it-before I knew how to
read-as a Recorded Books production from the Cambridge Public Library. From the first reel, I fell in love
with Tolkien‚Äôs world, and I listened to the whole book twice through. During the following winter, my father read The Lord ofthe Rings aloud to me before bedtime. Each night we would settle onto our living room couch to share a chapter or-if I had my way-two. On especially cold evenings, we would build a fire.
When we began with The Fellowship ofthe Ring, the thick blocs of text that filled each page remained an
impenetrable enigma to me, unlocked only by my father‚Äôs voice. But by the time we reached the last chapter
of The Return ofthe King, I could follow along with each word.</p>

  <p>Teaching me to read is just one of the ways Tolkien‚Äôs works have influenced me. As Christopher
Tolkien once said of his father‚Äôs stories, ‚ÄúAs strange as it may seem, I grew up in the world he created. For me, the cities of The Silmarillion are more real than Babylon.‚Äù Although I first encountered Middle-earth some three generations after J.R.R. Tolkien‚Äôs youngest son, his words speak to me with the same timeless quality captured in the books that defined both our childhoods. Already at the age of seven, I considered J.R.R. Tolkien‚Äôs world-building, his elegant prose, and his characterization to be the gold standard by which all other literature should be measured. Now, fifteen years on, if! were to deconstruct my most basic beliefs about history, politics, narrative, and morality, I suspect that many strands of my adult Weltanschauung would find root somewhere in his mythology.</p>

  <p>For me The Hobbit was, in many respects, a beginning. In my first encounter with the Recorded
Books version in the Cambridge library, I locate not only my introduction to Tolkien, but also the genesis of many of my favorite pastimes and academic interests. Adorning the front cover of the cassette case was Tokien‚Äôs iconic image of Smaug, the dragon sprawling across his lonely mountain of hoarded treasure. This image is for me the illustration, the picture that taught me how texts can be externalized through visual media. It helped instill in me a love of art that eventually led me to illustrate my own edition of The Hobbit, and which still finds expression in my drawings and oil paintings. In a similar manner, the voice of Rob Inglis, who narrated the Recorded Books production, continues to sound in my head each time I think of Bilbo, Gandalf, and the thirteen dwarves. Engles‚Äô masterful narration revealed to me how stories take on new life through the creative interpretation of each reader-an insight I draw on daily through my studies of History and German Literature. Finally, The Hobbit led me into a passion for collecting. Fascinated by the lore and scholarship surrounding Middle-earth, I soon began amassing dozens of books by or about Tolkien, with a special focus on my favorite of his stories, The Hobbit.</p>

  <p>This collection centers on my relationship with The Hobbit; it is an exploration of a single book and
of that book‚Äôs impact on my life. I have read The Hobbit at least once each year for fifteen years, and each of those readings has left a different set of memories and impressions. I find that the text changes for me as I bring it into conversation with my shifting locations, moods, and literary knowledge. The Hobbit on a mountain peak with a storm brewing is much different than The Hobbit in bed just before drifting off to sleep. In my annotations I will discuss what different editions of The Hobbit have meant for me, with regard both the physical qualities of the books themselves, as well as the conditions in which I read them. My bibliography will focus on The Hobbit-to the exclusion of The Lord ofthe Rings and other works by Tolkien-both because it is my favorite book, and also because I want to delve into The Hobbit in its own right, as it is significantly different than The Lord ofthe Rings in both style and tone. For this reason, I do not include all the Tolkien-related books I own, but only those most directly pertaining to The Hobbit.</p>

  <p>I have divided my collection into four sections, each organized alphabetically. First, ‚ÄúEditions and
Translations‚Äù includes my various copies of The Hobbit. Second, ‚ÄúCommentary and Scholarship‚Äù comprises
interpretations and reading aids, such as dictionaries, biographies, and reference books. Third, ‚ÄúArt and
Illustration‚Äù includes books that depict Middle-earth graphically. And finally, ‚ÄúRelated Works‚Äù brings some of my favorite novels from Alice in Wonderland to The Wind in the Willows into dialogue with The Hobbit in a discussion of inter-textuality.</p>

  <p>In an epigraph at the beginning of his Annotated Hobbit, Tolkien scholar Douglas Anderson suggests
that an ideal existence would be to settle down ‚Äúin the not too remote country where I could reread and
annotate my favorite books.‚Äù I am thankful for the opportunity to follow Anderson in his Hobbit-like wish. As Bilbo reminds us often enough, we are not always so lucky as to be at home ‚Äúby the fire with the kettle just beginning to sing,‚Äù but sometimes we do get the chance to record our journeys, before the road goes ever on.</p>

  <h3 id="i-editions-and-translations">I. Editions and Translations</h3>

  <p>1) <em>Tolkien, J.R.R. The Annotated Hobbit, annotated by Douglas A. Anderson. New York:
Houghton Mifflin Company, 2002.</em></p>

  <p>This is the definitive annotated edition of The Hobbit, revised and expanded in a beautiful
second edition. Annotator Douglas Anderson has provided a wonderful introduction, as well as
several appendices. One of these appendices is an unpublished final chapter of The Hobbit
entitled ‚ÄúThe Quest of Erebor‚Äù which explains Gandalf‚Äôs reasons for recruiting Bilbo for the
journey with Thorin and company. On each page of text for the original nineteen chapters,
Anderson has included expansive notes. These include information on the etymology of
Tolkien‚Äôs words and on the origins of his ideas and concepts for the books. The inspiration for
Gandalf, for example, first came from a German postcard showing an old man in a red cloak and
captioned ‚ÄúDer Berggeist.‚Äù Anderson also includes myriad illustrations (many in full color) from
the various editions of The Hobbit published around the world over the past eighty-two years. I
purchased this book at the beginning of last semester and enjoyed reading it throughout the fall. I
was particularly interested in its treatment of The Hobbit as a locus for Tolkien‚Äôs various
influences-in The Hobbit, Tolkien wedded mythology, philology, his favorite children stories,
his travels, his childhood memories, and his artistic talent (he produced an extensive set of
illustrations for the first edition, published in 1935).</p>

  <p>2) <em>Tolkien, J.R.R. The Hobbit. Audio recording produced by the Mind‚Äôs Eye. Novato, CA:
Soundelux Audio Publishing. no date.</em></p>

  <p>I picked up this audio recording at the Jumble Sale of the Swarthmore Friends Meeting
two years ago. It‚Äôs contained in a small wooden box and is a dramatized recording on several
cassette tapes with different actors reading the parts of each character. Sound effects are
included, and some text, such has dialogue tags, has been excluded. I love the idea behind the
recording, but in my mind, it will never stand up to that of Rob Inglis for Recorded Books! This
recording represents a genre of creative interpretations of The Hobbit of which I hope to collect
more in the future. For example, there are several comic books and parodies of The Hobbit which
I would like to pick up.</p>

  <p>3) <em>Tolkien, J.R.R. The Hobbit. Audio recording read by Rob Inglis. Recorded Books. no date.</em></p>

  <p>This recording is the time honored and classic production that first introduced me to
Tolkien‚Äôs world. While the Cambridge Public Library probably long ago discarded or sold the
original copy that I heard at age seven, I was thrilled to pick up my own copy at a local Barnes
and Noble. I purchased this recording, on nine cassette tapes, with Christmas money, I believe
when I was in the third grade. I also bought cassette tapes of the complete Lord ofthe Rings
trilogy. These tapes, dozens of hours in all, were the soundtrack to much of my childhood years.
I listened to them in my room when I was drawing or playing and on long car trips with my
family. Over the years, I internalized the inflections and intonations of narrator Rob Inglis, and
when I read The Hobbit aloud, I mimic his reading. Incidentally, the first time I listened to this
recording at age seven, the beginning of the first cassette tape was garbled, so I had to begin the
story part way through, with the encounter between Bilbo and the trolls. Aside from the
encounter with the tolls, my most explicit memory of listening to the audio book at age seven
was in the back seat of my parents‚Äô truck on the way to the Boston airport. I was listening to the
section on the Battle of Five Armies for the second time. My sister was sitting next to me, and I handed her the headphones, suggesting that the book was so awesome, she would like it too. At
age 4, she was less enamored than me.</p>

  <p>4) <em>Tolkien, J.R.R. Der kleine Hobbit. Munich: Deutscher Taschenbuch Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.,
2004.</em></p>

  <p>This is the first copy of The Hobbit that I purchased abroad. I bought it in 2005 in a large
bookstore in Berlin on a trip there with my family. I was beginning to study German at the time,
and I hoped to read my favorite book in German for practice. As it turns out, The Hobbit was an
excellent choice. It is easy to follow and has fairly simple sentence structure. Also, because much
of the mythology Tolkien incorporated into the book is based on Germanic traditions, German is
an excellent language to read it in. Words like ‚Äò dwarf,‚Äô ‚Äòdragon,‚Äô ‚Äòtroll,‚Äô and even ‚Äòhobbit‚Äô all
sound very proper in German. I read this book primarily in Colorado over two summers while
working at a summer camp. My German wasn‚Äôt very fluent at the time, meaning that it was
pretty slow going. But I know The Hobbit almost word for word, so even if I only knew a few
German words in each sentence, I could easily fill in the rest with my own knowledge of the
English version.</p>

  <p>5) <em>Tolkien, J.R.R. La hobbit: a la Riconquista del Tesoro, translated by Elena Jeronimidis Conte,
Milan : Adelphi Edizioni S.P.A., 2004.</em></p>

  <p>After buying a copy of The Hobbit in German, I decided that I would start collecting it in
other languages. On a trip to Rome with my parents , I found this edition in a local bookstore. I
hope that one day I can read Italian, but until then this book will remain an invitation to begin
learning the language. The volume is red with a picture on the cover depicting one of the great
eagles-originally painted by Tolkien for the first British edition. The Hobbit has been translated
into many other languages. (Tolkien made extensive notes for translators on just what emotions
and traditions invented words like ‚Äòhobbit‚Äô or ‚Äò Carrock‚Äô ought to evoke .) From Finish to
Japanese, I have many more copies to collect! And new translations are popping up all the time.
Just this last year, a new translation of The Hobbit appeared in Latin.</p>

  <p>6) <em>J.R.R. Tolkien. The Hobbit. Illustrated by me. 2002-2013</em></p>

  <p>When I was twelve, I began illustrating The Hobbit. The movie of The Fellowship ofthe
Ring had just come out, which I enjoyed very much, and for Christmas my parents gave me a
book on the art production for the movie. Inspired by the drawings and diagrams in this book, I
began illustrating The Hobbit in my own style. Significantly, I picked The Hobbit, rather than
The Lord a/the Rings to illustrate. I did this for two reasons. First, The Hobbit was my favorite
book, and second, it was shorter and would therefore require fewer illustrations complete
(although I did envision eventually illustrating The Lord a/the Rings as well). My illustrations
are influenced by the art direction of Peter Jackson‚Äôs movies, but they are not entirely derivative.
For example, where visions that I had had in my mind prior to watching the movie differed from
the cinematic version , I always chose to portray my own images. Also, I had always loved
Tolkien‚Äôs original illustrations for The Hobbit. I did not want to diverge from his representations,
so I often incorporated elements of his illustrations into my own. (It is also worth noting that
these were not the first or only illustrations of Tolkien‚Äôs work that I have done . I did my first
Tolkien-inspired illustrations-of Cirith Ungol and Barad Dur-at age eight.) I worked on my
project to illustrate The Hobbit on and offthrough my high school years, and completed
approximately three illustrations per chapter for the first nine chapters. I still hope to finish the
project one day. When I have illustrated the whole book, I plan to bind the illustrations with a
copy of the text. While traveling in Morocco last year, I found a red leather book cover at a local market. The craftsman who was selling it offered to print a few words on the cover in gold leaf,
and so I had him imprint ‚ÄúTHE HOBBIT‚Äù in bold capitals. When it‚Äôs all bound, it should have
the look of ‚ÄúThe Red Book‚Äù in which Bilbo supposedly wrote down his tale.</p>

  <p>7) <em>Tolkien, J.R.R. The Hobbit. New York: Ballantine Books, Inc., 1966.</em></p>

  <p>This is an old paperback copy of The Hobbit. It says ‚ÄúOfficial Authorized Edition‚Äù on the
back above Tolkien‚Äôs printed signature. This label was introduced to distinguish the book from
contraband facsimile editions that were being circulated at the time in violation of copyright. It
was such a popular book that American publishers didn ‚Äòt wait for rights to get a corner on the
market. I bought this book several years ago at my favorite used book shop, The Dusty
Bookshelf, in Lawrence, Kansas. The picture on the cover is a 1960s illustration that was not
done by Tolkien. This is my oldest copy of The Hobbit, and it is one of the first revised editions,
in which Tolkien altered the text of the book to accommodate the storyline of The Lord ofthe
Rings. In the original 1935 edition, there are several major differences. The most notable occurs
in the chapter ‚ÄúRiddles in the Dark‚Äù (which has long been my favorite chapter) in which Biblo
wins the one ring from Gollum in a riddle game, rather than finding in the cave floor prior to
meeting Gollum, as he does in later editions. The switch is important for Biblo‚Äôs psychology and
is explained by Gandalf in the first book of The Fellowship ofthe Ring. Swarthmore College
owns a copy of the first American edition of The Hobbit, which was bought at the request of
Craig Williamson, and it is housed in the rare book room. One day my friend Chris and I got a
chance to look at it with librarian Anne Garrison. We were so excited to see a copy with the
original text and went through the whole book finding details that diverge from contemporary
editions. While scholars have long noted the major change in Bilbo‚Äôs finding of the ring, we
were excited to make a different discovery, which we had never seen mentioned before: in the
original edition, Gollum is not a lost and wizened hobbit, but rather some unrelated cave
creature. Very important for his own psychology and characterization as well!</p>

  <p>8) <em>Tolkien, J.R.R. The Hobbit. New York: Ballantine Books, Inc., 1973.</em></p>

  <p>I also bought this copy at The Dusty Bookshelf in Lawrence. It is a slightly more recent
paperback from Ballantine, and the cover illustration is one of Tolkien‚Äôs original illustrations and
depicts Bilbo riding a barrel into the Long Lake before arriving with the dwarves in Lake Town.
I remember reading sections of it in my room at home. I keep it on a long lower shelf on the
south side of my room which holds many of my Tolkien books.</p>

  <p>9) <em>Tolkien, J.R.R. The Hobbit. New York: Ballantine Publishing Group, 1980.</em></p>

  <p>This is a green book with a picture of Hobbiton on the front. I bought it at a used book
store in Buena Vista, Colorado on a sweltering afternoon in June of2011. At the time I was
leading backpacking trips for the summer camp I work at, and I had the afternoon off while the
group of kids I was working with that week were on a rafting trip. My fellow trip leaders and I
decided to read a book to the next group of campers, and the following week we read The Hobbit
aloud from cover to cover to a group of eight or nine middle schoolers. It was amazing to read
the book during a backpacking trip, as The Hobbit is also about a journey. During our trip, we
explored caves, climbed high peaks, swam in lakes, and slid down talus slopes-all things that
Bilbo does in his own adventures. Often, our current location or the mood of the weather
reflected the events of the story. We spent one stormy afternoon huddled in our sleeping bags
listening to ‚ÄúThe Gathering of the Clouds.‚Äù My favorite moment was when we read a chapter on
the top ofa 13,000 foot mountain, Bushnell Peak, overlooking the San Louis Valley. When storm clouds started gathering, we packed up and scrambled down the mountain as fast as we
could!</p>

  <p>10) <em>Tolkien, J.R.R. The Hobbit. New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1972.</em></p>

  <p>A clothbound volume, this book belonged to my mother as a child . It has the black,
white, green, and blue just jacket that Tolkien designed for the original British edition. Tolkien
originally intended the sun and the dragon , which here appear in white , to be drawn in red. The
publishers decided to leave the red out as it cost too much to add an extra color. More recent
editions that use this dust jacket design, such as the 75th anniversary edition, show the dragon
and sun in red. I‚Äôve read through this volume a couple oftimes, but not in recent years. I
remember reading it in our living room before my father remodeled the lower level of our house.
The cover is creased and a little torn in places. I always thought of this volume as somewhat
antiquated and belonging to a past much older than myself-it made me think about The Hobbit
as a book with age that belonged to a tradition stretching back to my mother‚Äôs youth.</p>

  <p>11) <em>J.R.R. Tolkien. The Hobbit. New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1994.</em></p>

  <p>This is my favorite copy of The Hobbit. It is a green leather edition with the title, author,
and runic inscriptions imprinted on the cover in gold leaf. The interior includes all ofTolkien‚Äôs
original illustrations. These were not always included in the paperback books I had first read, or
even in the hardback from the 70s that belonged to my mother. In this volume I saw some of
Tolkien‚Äôs illustrations for the first time-including his paintings of the eagles‚Äô eerie and of
Hobbiton. I bought the book at a Barnes and Noble when I might have been fourteen or fifteen. I
already had the leather bound edition of The Lord ofthe Rings, and I wanted one of The Hobbit
as well. It is primarily ornamental; I have never actually sat down and read this copy (I‚Äôm afraid
of damaging it), but I look through it often.</p>

  <p>12) <em>Tolkien, J.R.R. The Hobbit. New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1997.</em></p>

  <p>When I first checked out The Hobbit on tape from the Cambridge Public Library, I was
browsing in the children‚Äôs audio book section with my mother, where we often picked up
recorded books for me. I saw The Hobbit and was intrigued by cover illustration of the red
dragon on his golden hoard. But I was skeptical of the title The Hobbit, which sounded odd to
me. I didn‚Äôt initially want to check it out, but my mother, not remembering having read it herself
as a child, told me that my father liked it and that I probably would too. Later, after having been
especially impressed by The Battle of Five Armies, I talked about the book with my father. He
said he had also really liked The Lord ofthe Rings and suggested that we read it together. The
name The Lord ofthe Rings initially sounded odd to me as well; I pictured a strange figure sitting
at a table with a set of rings laid out before him. My father convinced me that I would like the
book despite my doubts , and we went to the local Barnes and Noble to buy a copy. We were
living on our own at the time; my mother and sister were living in Indiana, and my father and I
were in Kansas. We were separated for just one year because of my parents ‚Äò jobs, so my father
and I had some bonding time. Our evening readings of The Lord ofthe Rings are my most vivid
memories of that year. When we got to the bookstore , we looked at two different copies of The
Lord ofthe Rings. The first was a red leather bound edition. I think it may be one I later bought,
but I also remember it having a black and white picture crammed with orcs, which my copy
doesn‚Äôt have. IfI‚Äôm remembering correctly and there is a volume with that illustration, I would
very much like to find it again. Anyway, we decided to go for a less expensive and more
versatile boxed set with copies of The Hobbit and each of the three volumes of The Lord ofthe
Rings. Each book had a simple white and gray cover with designs and words in single colors.</p>

  <p>Each book had a different color. The Hobbit‚Äôs color was red. We didn ‚Äòt read it together that year,
as I had already heard it twice on tape the year before. But I did read this particular volumes a
few times in later years. Every time I look at it, it still reminds me of that trip to the bookstore
which for me was a very physical entre to The Lord ofthe Rings. The memory of comparing
editions at the bookstore was also influential for the way I have thought about book collecting
and specifically my Hobbit collection ever since.</p>

  <h3 id="ii-commentary-and-scholarship">II. Commentary and Scholarship</h3>

  <p>13) <em>Carpenter, Humphrey, The Letters ofJR.R. Tolkien, Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company,
1981.</em></p>

  <p>In this thick hard cover volume, Humphrey Carpenter has collected and edited J.R.R.
Tolkien‚Äôs personal letters. Many of these are family letters and still others are exchanges with his
various publishers, especially Allen &amp; Unwin. Carpenter has selected those letters which most
directly pertain to the development ofTolkien‚Äôs legendarium. For me the most interesting
selections are those which deal with the saga of writing, publishing and revising the Hobbit. The
letters reveal especially Tolkien‚Äôs revision process. He accepted many suggestions from readers
and changed the text of The Hobbit several times. In one example, Tolkien switched out the word
‚Äútomatoes‚Äù for ‚Äúpickles‚Äù because he wanted to keep his flora primarily English, and tomatoes are
an American food and name. Letters has taught me that Tolkien‚Äôs process was one filled with
conversation and dialogue. He did not invent his world in isolation, but rather in partnership with
his family, his colleagues, his publishers, and his readers. Today, Letters reminds us that we are
ourselves in a conversation with Tolkien, and each time we read his works , they take on new
meaning as we roll them into our own cosmologies, writings, relationships, and lives.</p>

Kocher, Paul, Master ofMiddle-earth: The Fiction ofJR.R. Tolkien. Boston: Houghton Mifflin,
1972.</em></p>

  <p>These biographies of Tolkien have given me some valuable insight into the great author
himself. He spent his first years in South Africa, was close to his brother Hillary, and was a
devoted Roman Catholic . Of course his many life experiences colored and shaped his life‚Äôs
work. From traumatic childhood events (he was bit once by a poisonous spider in South Africaeventually giving rise to the chapter ‚ÄúFlies and Spiders‚Äù in The Hobbit)-to seemingly arcane
philology seminars at Oxford, understanding the experiences of the author is imperative for the
interpretation of his books. When I read biographies of Tolkien, I am usually most struck by just
how different his life was from mine. We share the common first language of English, are both
male, and have led middle or upper middle class lives. But it is still difficult for me to grasp the
great span of time-especially the pre WWII world in which Tolkien wrote The Hobbit-that
separates us. Because I identify so intimately with Tolkien‚Äôs works , it is shocking to me that his
daily life could have been so different than mine ; how could someone with such a different
background write something that speaks to me so clearly? I get this feeling more often with
Tolkien biographies than with the biographies of any other individual.</p>

  <p>These are encyclopedias of Middle-earth. In all three books, entries are organized
alphabetically (i.e. from Arkenstone to Zirakzigil). Entries can range from just one sentence to
over a page in length. The encyclopedias are invaluable because they compile all of the
knowledge contained in Tolkien‚Äôs voluminous writings and present it an accessible fashion. So if
I‚Äôm curious about Gandalf‚Äôs history or want to know how Moon Letters work, I can just flip
though one of these reference works to find the answer. Just randomly reading through them is
fun as well. Robert Foster‚Äôs A Guide to Middle-earth is particularly well designed and
comprehensive.</p>

  <p>16) <em>Noel, Ruth. The Languages ofTolkien ‚Äòs Middle-earth. New York: Houghton Mifflin
Company. 1980.</em></p>

  <p>This book provides a critical analysis and complete dictionary for all of the fourteen
languages that Tolkien invented for the various races and creatures of Middle-earth. Quenya and
Sindarin, the two Elvish languages, are the most highly developed, but the book also includes
information on Dwarvish, Entish, the Black Speech, and many others. This book introduced me
to comparative linguistics and inspired me to learn a bit ofElvish on my own. I began with
Sindarin, because it was the ‚Äòlower‚Äô language of the Elves and was supposedly easier to learn. I
never got terribly far, but I did translate several texts from The Lord ofthe Rings and even wrote
them out in the proper Tengwar script. In The Hobbit, most of the characters speak the common
tongue, or Westron, which Tolkien suggests is close (or at least easily translated) to modem
English. Elvish does appear a number of times, however-most often in place names, such as
Gondolin, and object names, like Glamdring, and characters‚Äô names, like Elrond. The dwarves‚Äô
names are not actually given in Dwarvish, but rather an old eastern common tongue that predates
Westron. This is the same language that produced the name Gandalf-only one of the wizards
many appellations. In Elvish, for example, his name is Mithrandir.</p>

  <p>These are my four commentaries on Tolkien‚Äôs work which most directly bear on The
Hobbit. Most commentaries, including all of these actually, tend to focus on The Lord ofthe
Rings as opposed to any of Tolkien‚Äôs other writings. That is certainly understandable as they are
his most popular and bestselling books. But these all have sections with direct bearing on The
Hobbit as well. Tom Shippey‚Äôs books are particularly interesting. In The Road to Middle-earth,
Shippey discusses the evolution of Tolkien‚Äôs Legendarium and links his writings to Old English
literature and to philology. Shippey is one ofthe world‚Äôs leading Tolkien experts, and his
analysis of Tolkien‚Äôs relationship to medieval texts like Beowulf is excellent. In Author ofthe
Century, Shippey builds on his earlier Tolkien scholarship to argue that Tolkien‚Äôs linguistic
abilities place him among the greatest writers of the last century. I was excited to hear Tom
Shippey speak when he came to Swarthmore to give presentations on the philology of Middleearth and on his role as a consultant for the Peter Jackson movies.</p>

  <p>18) <em>Tolkien, lR.R. The Monsters and the Critics: And Other Essays. Grafton, 1997.</em></p>

  <p>Tolkien, J.R.R. The Tolkien Reader: Stories, Poems, and Commentary by the Author of ‚ÄòThe
Hobbit‚Äô and ‚ÄòThe Lord ofthe Rings. ‚Äò New York: Ballantine Books, Inc., 1975.
These two anthologies of Tolkien‚Äôs work include key insights by Tolkien himself into his
own work. Last night I happened to read Walter Kaufman‚Äôs introduction to Nietsche‚Äôs Ecce
Homo, an autobiographical retrospective of the philosopher‚Äôs previous works. In his
introduction, Kaufman claims that Ecce Homo is one of his favorite Nietsche books because it
includes the author‚Äôs own commentary on his work: ‚Äúwe should gladly trade the whole vast
literature on Nietzsche for this one small book. Who would not rather have Shakespeare on
Shakespeare, including the poet‚Äôs own reflections on his plays and poems, than the exegeses and
conjectures of thousands of critics and professors?‚Äù Kaufman might overstate the case a bit, but
his comment does remind me that my own thinking about Tolkien‚Äôs work has been strongly
influenced by these essays. The Tolkien Reader includes a section called ‚ÄúOn Fairy-Stories,‚Äù in
which Tolkien explains how to write a good fantasy tale. The next section is ‚ÄúLeaf by Niggle,‚Äù in
which he puts his ideas into practice and produces a ‚Äúfairy-story.‚Äù The story is particularly fun
because it revolves around nature symbolism (trees and leaves) and has been influential for
scholars who have written about environmentalism in Tolkien‚Äôs works. The Monsters and the
Critics contains Tolkien‚Äôs most famous essay on Beowulf, which he rescued from ‚Äúthe critics,‚Äù
repositioning it from its early twentieth century status as a minor medieval soap opera into the
foundational text of English literature. Learning about Tolkien‚Äôs approach to medieval texts as
(and specifically their influence on his own works) has shown me that all writers channel the
books they have read and loved. Just as Beowulfis Tolkien‚Äôs foundational text, The Hobbit may
be mine.</p>

  <p>19) <em>Tolkien, lR.R. The Peoples ofMiddle-Earth, edited by Christopher Tolkien. New York:
Houghton Mifflin Company, 1996.</em></p>

  <p>This is the twelfth and final volume of Christopher Tolkien‚Äôs edited series The Histories
ofMiddle-earth. Christopher Tolkien has spent decades editing and unpublished works of his
father and has published them systematically. Many of the volumes in this series explore early
drafts of The Silmarilion and The Lord ofthe Rings. It‚Äôs fascinating to read how Tolkien
originally conceived each character and chapter. Christopher Tolkien chose, however, not to
issue a book on the history of The Hobbit, as he considered of tangential relation to the other
stories of Middle-earth and felt that its style did not fit with his father‚Äôs other major works. A
two volume History ofthe Hobbit, with complete early drafts of the book, has been compiled and
edited by John Rateliff and was published in 2007 by Houghton Mifflin. I hope to add these
books to my collection soon. For years, however, I have had to content myself with The Peoples
ofMiddle-Earth, which is a history of the prologue and appendices to The Lord ofthe Rings. It
does not directly concern The Hobbit, but is more useful than any of the other books in The
Histories for understanding Tolkien‚Äôs thoughts on hobbits themselves, as a good section of this
volume is devoted to the evolution of his essay, ‚ÄúConcerning Hobbits.‚Äù</p>

  <p>20) <em>Green, Michael. A Hobbit‚Äôs Travels: being the hitherto unpublished Travel Sketches ofSam
Gamgee with space for notes. Philadelphia: Running Press, 1978.</em></p>

  <p>This is a blank diary filled with marginal pictures inspired by the flora, fauna, and
architecture of The Lord ofthe Rings. It is intended to be used as a trip journal, and I recorded
my first and second visits to Europe-in 2004 and 2005-in its pages. I think my parents gave it to me for Christmas one year. Being entitled A Hobbit‚Äôs Travels, I always associated it more
closely with The Hobbit than The Lord ofthe Rings-also, I think, because the pictures are
generally brightly colored and whimsical and therefore more in the style of Bilbo‚Äôs adventures
than Sam‚Äôs. I love the idea of tracing my own journey along side that of Tolkien‚Äôs hobbits‚Äô.
Their escapades provide a framework with clear reference points for my own travels. That the
journey is represented through art rather than text in this volume has been particularly significant
for me. By showing a hobbit‚Äôs journey through illustration, Michael Green created a world
partway between Tolkien‚Äôs and his own. When I recorded my own journeys in this book, I built
on both of their creativity to form a new tripartite dialogue that brought text, art, and personal
experience together in a unique way.</p>

  <p>21) <em>Hammond, Wayne and Christina Scull. JR.R. Tolkien: Artist and Illustrator. London:
Harper Collins, 1995.</em></p>

  <p>Artist and Illustrator was one of my favorite Christmas presents from my parents this
year. It is the most comprehensive published collection of Tolkien‚Äôs drawings and paintings. It
includes sections on his early artwork, his pictures for The Hobbit, those for The Lord ofthe
Rings, and his graphic and ornamental design work. Tolkien took art lessons as a boy and was
encouraged to draw and paint especially by his mother. Many of his boyhood drawings are
included in this book. He particularly enjoyed depicting seaside scenes, townscapes, a few
cityscapes, and trees. He never professed to be particularly good with the human form. The
section on the art of The Lord ofthe Rings was very interesting for me, as I had never seen the
majority of Tolkien‚Äôs illustrations for the book; almost none of them have ever accompanied the
text. The final section on design was also fascinating; the authors discuss how Art Nouveau
influenced Tolkien‚Äôs calligraphy and artwork. Authors Wayne Hammond and Christina Scull
argue in their introduction that understanding Tolkien‚Äôs illustrations is critical to unlocking his
texts. His pictures reveal much about the way he saw his world, and they are impressive works of
art in their own right. This is especially true for The Hobbit, which is the only book Tolkien ever
comprehensively illustrated.</p>

  <p>22) <em>Lee, Alan. The Lord ofthe Rings Sketchbook. New York: Harper Collins Publishers, 2003.</em></p>

  <p>Another Christmas present from my parents, Alan Lee‚Äôs Sketchbook has significantly
influenced the way I visualize Tolkien‚Äôs Middle-earth. Lee was one of the two main concept
artists for Peter Jackson‚Äôs Lord ofthe Rings movies, and through those films, millions of people
have become acquainted with his style, if only in its cinematic manifestation. I had known about
Alan Lee for years before Peter Jackson began filming The Fellowship ofthe Ring. At the time,
Lee was already a well known illustrator of Tolkien. The box containing The Hobbit and The
Lord ofthe Rings, which my father and I purchased in 1998 to read at bedtime, prominently
displayed an Alan Lee illustration of the Nazgul king riding a fell beast near Minas Tirith. One of
my friends also had the complete set of The Lord ofthe Rings illustrated by Lee. In the near
future, I hope to pick up a copy of The Hobbit with Lee illustrations. I have copied a number of
Lee‚Äôs sketches and employed his style and ideas throughout much of my work. When reading
Hammond and Scull‚Äôs Artist and Illustrator this winter, I was surprised to realize that there are
actually close similarities between Lee‚Äôs illustrations and several of those that Tolkien completed
decades earlier (I am thinking particularly of Tolkien‚Äôs watercolor of the Old Forest).</p>

  <p>23) <em>Russell, Gary. The Lord ofthe Rings: The Art ofthe Fellowship ofthe Ring. New York:
Harper Collins Publishers, 2002.</em></p>

  <p>This is a hardback coffee table book that discusses the concept and visual art for Peter
Jackson‚Äôs film version of The Fellowship ofthe Ring. There many sections on the illustrations of
John Howe and Alan Lee (my love ofthis book prompted my parents to get me The Lord ofthe
Rings Sketchbook a year or two later), as well as sections on costume and set design. A
Christmas present from my parents in 2002, this book directly inspired the majority of my
Tolkien drawings, including my project to illustrate The Hobbit. Many of the pages in this book
are still crystal clear in my mind, and conceptually, it is my go-to reference whenever I think
about any number of topics, including medieval architecture, cinema production, and
landscaping.</p>

  <p>24) <em>Smith, Chris. The Lord ofthe Rings: Weapons and Warfare. New York: Harper Collins
Publishers, 2003.</em></p>

  <p>I liked The Art ofthe Fellowship ofthe Ring so much that after Peter Jackson‚Äôs Return of
the King came out, I immediately bought the corresponding book for that movie. This one was
less art oriented and focused on weapons and warfare. I would have preferred more drawings and
concept art, but was still very happy with the extensive articles and pictures on the mechanics
and history behind the combat scenes in Jackson‚Äôs movies. Many of the pictures in this book
have also influenced my drawing and artwork.</p>

  <h2 id="iv-related-works">IV. Related Works</h2>

  <p>25)<em>Adams, Richard. Watership Down. New York, Avon Books, 1972.</em></p>

  <p>If The Hobbit wasn‚Äôt already my favorite book, Watership Down might be. I often think
about it in connection to The Hobbit, and I find many similarities in the stories. My father also
read me Watership Down for the first time when I was eight and we were living on our own in
Topeka. Of the books we read that year, The Lord ofthe Rings and Watership Down are the two
that I recall most vividly. The journey of Hazel, Fiver, and their friends parallels Bilbo‚Äôs
surprisingly closely. It is episodic, much of the action takes place underground (many
commentators have noted the similarities between the name and behavior of ‚Äòrabbits‚Äô and of
Tolkien‚Äôs ‚Äòhobbits‚Äô), there are talking birds, and it ends with a major battle. In the same way that
Tolkien created a sprawling, convincing, and exciting literary world, Richard Adams succeeded
in etching Watership Down and Efrafa onto my mental landscape. As with The Hobbit, I have
tried to read Watership Down regularly over the years. Often, I read it in the springtime when the
rabbits are just coming out of their holes.</p>

  <p>26) <em>Alexander, Michael and Anonymous. Beowulf. Penguin Classics, 2003.</em></p>

  <p>Without Beowulf, there would be no Bilbo Baggins. Of this, Tolkien scholars are quite
certain. Tolkien‚Äôs Middle-earth mythology evolved out of his love for medieval texts and
especially his passion for the epic, Beowulf. He translated this book, as well as other Old and
Middle English texts, including Pearl, Sir Orfeo, and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. I own
all these books, but none of them are Tolkien‚Äôs own translations. I hope to pick up those
translated by Tolkien in the near future. Many scholars, including Swarthmore‚Äôs own Craig
Williamson, have extensively documented the influences of Beowulf on The Hobbit.</p>

  <p>27) <em>Asimov, Isaac. Foundation. Spectra, 1991.</em>
In my literary pantheon, the second greatest and second most extensive imaginary world
ever created (after Tolkien‚Äôs Middle-earth) is the universe ofIsaac Asimov‚Äôs Foundation. From I Robot to Foundation and Earth, Asimov created a seventeen volume, multi-millennial universe. Asimov uses his science fiction to delve into questions of ethics, science, and historyas well as narrative and characterization. Science Fiction and Fantasy are two sides of the same coin, and for me, Asimov and Tolkien were the premier representatives of their respective genres in the mid-twentieth century. Earlier representatives of the science fiction genre who have been particularly significant for me are Jules Verne and H.G. Wells.</p>

  <p>28) <em>arroll, Lewis. Alice‚Äôs Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass. New
York: Signet, 2000.</em></p>

  <p>Any book that begins with a journey down a rabbit hole cannot help being compared with
another book that begins, ‚ÄúIn a hole in the ground, there lived a hobbit.‚Äù I actually didn‚Äôt read
Lewis Carroll‚Äôs books until after my senior year of high school, but I knew the story well from
films and popular culture, and I always classed the Alice stories with Tolkien‚Äôs The Hobbit.
There‚Äôs something in late nineteenth! early twentieth century British children‚Äôs literature that
binds the genre together-some common essence that I find intrinsically appealing. Maybe it‚Äôs
the authors‚Äô focus on talking animals. Perhaps it‚Äôs the whimsy. Or again maybe it‚Äôs the focus on
children and little people. I never considered Alice all that different in age from Bilbo (even
though he‚Äôs some fifty years old during his adventure with Gandalf and the dwarves), probably
because Bilbo and Alice are the same height.</p>

  <p>29) <em>Lewis, C.S. The Chronicles ofNarnia, New York: Harper Collins, 2001.</em></p>

  <p>Any Tolkien-oriented book collection would be remiss to omit a reference to C.S. Lewis.
Tolkien and Lewis were friends and members of the by now infamous Oxford literary club
known as the ‚ÄúInklings.‚Äù Tolkien, Lewis, and their friends would meet for beer and discuss their
writings. The thematic elements and style of The Chronicles ofNarnia and The Hobbit draw on
similar sources and were created, literally, in dialogue with each other. C.S. Lewis also wrote
one of the first (and most positive) reviews of The Hobbit when it appeared in 1935. I think the
act of traveling from rural England through a wardrobe to a magical land must approximate how
Tolkien wanted his readers to imagining entering the world of The Hobbit. Much of the shire and
the surrounding lands draw on elements of rural England, but they are also different, magical,
other.</p>

  <p>30) <em>Porter, Jane. The Scottish Chiefs. New York: Simon &amp; Shuster, 1991.</em></p>

  <p>Although I find little in common between the stories of The Hobbit and The Scottish
Chiefs, I often mentally pair the two books. The Scottish Chiefs was the first book illustrated by
N.C. Wyeth that I ever purchased (at age 10). Wyeth is my favorite illustrator, and his paintings
significantly influenced the way I chose to portray Tolkien‚Äôs Middle-earth in my own drawings
of The Hobbit. As two of my favorite books, The Hobbit and The Scottish Chiefs are both
displayed prominently on the south wall of my room. Their proximity and prominent locations
alone are enough to forever link them in my mind-along with the many other Wyeth illustrated
books I have on display in my room.</p>

  <p>31) <em>Grahame, Kenneth. The Wind in the Willows. New York: Avon Books, 1966.</em>
The Wind in the Willows has been one of my favorite books since well before I read The
Hobbit. My mother read it to me at age three and then again two years later. I remember this
second reading clearly-I loved the wonderful arc ofthe story that runs from Mole‚Äôs cluttered
hole to rat‚Äôs house, to the river, Badger‚Äôs, adventures with Mr. Toad, prison, a train, a barge, and
a final underground invasion of Toad Hall. Mr. Toad may be a poor approximation for Gandalf, but for me, Mole certainly prefigured Bilbo. The tension between the ideas of ‚Äòhome‚Äô and ‚Äòjourney‚Äô especially links the characters. The Wind in the Willows ends with Mole‚Äôs return to his hole, while The Hobbit concludes with Bilbo back in the comfort of his own hobbit hole, smoking pipeweed with Gandalf and Badin. (This trope is most poignantly exemplified in the final line of The Lord ofthe Rings, when Sam says, ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm back.‚Äù During his visit to Swarthmore, Tom Shippey called this ‚Äúthe most tragic line in all of western literature.‚Äù)</p>

  <p>32) <em>Homer, The Odyssey, translated by George Herbert Palmer. New York: Houghton Mifflin
Company, 1949.</em></p>

  <p>I actually didn‚Äôt explicitly make the connection to myself until quite recently, but of
course, The Hobbit is a modem-day odyssey. It‚Äôs a little too glib to suggest that Gollum is Scylla
to the ore‚Äôs Charybdis, that Beorn is Circe, or that Smaug is Polyphemus. But Tolkien surely had
a twinkle in his eye when he turned the brawny and battle-hardened Odysseus into the portly
country gentleman of Mr. Bilbo Baggins. In addition to the episodic nature and general structure
of the plot, The Hobbit borrows much from Homer‚Äôs Odyssey. Tolkien‚Äôs interest in riddling,
wordplay, and trickery comes to mind, for instance. Bilbo‚Äôs games with Gollum-as well as
Gandalf‚Äôs interactions with the tolls and with Beorn‚Äîehannel the spirit of Homer‚Äôs ancient
Greek heroes. The ideas of home and homecoming also play central roles in both texts (and in
the figure of Lobelia Sackville-Baggins, we surely catch some allusion to Penelope‚Äôs suitors).</p>

  <p>33) <em>Tolkien, J.R.R. The Adventures ofTom Bombadil. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company,
1991.</em></p>

  <p>Tom Bombadil is essentially an epic whimsical poem. It tells the story of one of The Lord
ofthe Ring‚Äôs oddest characters, and it is recounted in a style much closer to The Hobbit than The
Lord ofthe Rings. This particular edition includes many wonderful illustrations, as well as a
selection of Tolkien‚Äôs poems, some of which are related to Middle-earth and some of which are
not. I found this book in my grandparents‚Äô basement when I was maybe thirteen or so. At the
time, I hadn‚Äôt started to research Tolkien terribly extensively and only knew about those books
for sale at my local bookseller-which did not include The Adventures ofTom Bombadil. So
when I discovered that there was a whole book devoted to Tom Bombadil, it was like
discovering a lost chapter of The Lord ofthe Rings. Finding the book was a physical reminder of
the true extensiveness of Tolkien‚Äôs legendarium.</p>

  <p>34) <em>Tolkien, IR.R. The Lord ofthe Rings. New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1994.</em></p>

  <p>This is my favorite copy of The Lord ofthe Rings. It is a large red leather bound edition
that I purchased with Christmas money around 2004 or so. It has its own box and the spine is
adorned with a gold gilt tree, which I think represents the white tree of Gondor. This book is the
companion to my green leather bound edition of The Hobbit. Technically, The Hobbit should be
the one in red, as Frodo refers to it as The Red Book, but I‚Äôm willing to forgive the publishers the
oversight. The father of one of my childhood friends had two copies of this edition of The Lord
ofthe Rings. One was from his college years and it was thoroughly dog-eared and beaten up. The
newer one was pristine. As a kid, whenever I discussed The Lord ofthe Rings with my friend and
his father, we would always pull out these two red leather volumes and go over the text together.
This experience was probably my first equivalent of a literature seminar. (My friend‚Äôs father‚Äôs
other favorite author was Asimov, and we did much the same thing with the Foundation novels.)
Because of these memories, I consider this particular iteration of The Lord ofthe Rings to be the
definitive edition. Also, Tolkien originally intended The Lord ofthe Rings to be published in one volume, so it is appropriate that this definitive edition be only one volume rather than three
separate books.</p>

  <p>35) <em>Tolkien, J.R.R.. Roverandom. New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1995.</em></p>

  <p>36) <em>Tolkien, J.R.R. Roverandom. Published by some company in Turkey, 2007.</em></p>

  <p>Tolkien wrote Roverandom in 1925 for his son Michael, who had recently lost a toy dog.
In the story, a wizard turns a dog, Rover, into a toy which then goes on adventures to the moon
and under the sea. Written a decade before The Hobbit, Rover prefigures Bilbo in the same way
that the wizard in Roverandom prefigures Gandalf. After reading this book, I came to think of
The Hobbit as one of several whimsical children‚Äôs stories that Tolkien wrote in the 1920s and
30s and which only grew to have major mythological significance because it later led to the
creation of The Lord ofthe Rings. To think about The Hobbit in its first decade of existence
means imagining it without The Lord ofthe Rings. That‚Äôs a difficult prospect for many of us, but
reading Roverandom and thinking about it as a single book without a blockbuster sequel provides
one possible avenue of conceptualizing what it must have been like to read The Hobbit between
1935 and 1944. Roverandom was posthumously published for the first time in 1998. The cover
includes a wonderful watercolor by Tolkien of Rover under the ocean. I have two copies of this
book. One of them I picked up this summer in Istanbul, and it is in Turkish. I was looking around
for a copy of The Hobbit in Turkish, but couldn‚Äôt find one, so I settled for a Turkish edition of
Roverandom.</p>

  <p>37) <em>Tolkien, J.R.R. Smith of Wootton Major and Farmer Giles ofHam. New York: Ballantine
Books, 1967.</em></p>

  <p>Like Roverandom and The Adventures ofTom Bombadil, Smith of Wootton Major and
Farmer Giles ofHam are two short children‚Äôs books that are written in a style similar to The
Hobbit. I have especially enjoyed Farmer Giles ofHam, which like The Hobbit, is a story about
an unlikely hero who sets out to best a dragon. Both Smith and Farmer have medieval settings
and are amusing but fairly modest fairy-stories.</p>
